# MongoDB_CRUD_With_Frontend_REST_API
This is a demonstration of full CRUD with MongoDB using a REST API and a user interface to demonstrate functionality. It deals with a database with 3 collections, one for clients, one for physiotherapists, and one for appointments. All three collections can be added to via the front end forms in order to record new clients, new therapists, and new sessions relating to both previous collections. Therapists can have multiple clients. Specified data can be deleted from any collection via a button, and each collection can be retrieved and displayed in a text box. Updates are hard coded and exist for all three collections. NodeJS and AJAX are used for this demontration.
